About the Project

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a game in which two people take turns filling in the space and the
person who completes one line first wins. Our project extends the original **Tic-Tac-Toe** 3X3 game to the 4X4 version. Make the colors of o and x diverse, and
increase the size of the game board. Also, it shows the order so that you know
who's turn is, and asks if you want to play again after the game.
